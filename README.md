The sort by and filter by genre drop down menu are not visible on the chrome screen recording, but they are present and well structured on the actual webpage. 

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

This week's in-class demo code was very helpful to start working on Flixster. Fetching data from the Pokemon API and implementing components to display it using react prepared me well to work with APIs. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have completed the side bar stretch feature which included adding watched and favorite sections.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Always having slides helps with my presentation flow. I had notes instead of slides but next time I will try to always have a mini powerpoint ready.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Instructor Devarsh for guiding me through implementing the sidebar and how the components are supposed to interact (props and linking up state) for the functionality to be achieved.
